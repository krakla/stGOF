#'  PCB Concentration Data
#'
#' In a study on the effect of environmental pollutants on animals, Risebrough
#' (1972) gives data on the concentration of several chemicals in the yolk lipids
#' of pelican eggs. The data considered here are the PCB
#' (polychlorinated biphenyl) concentrations for 65 Anacapa birds.
#' In the original study the mean PCB concentration in Anacapa eggs was compared
#' to the mean concentration in eggs of other birds. Here we concentrate on the
#' Anacapa eggs
